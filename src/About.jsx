            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Robert and I specialize in handcrafted wood and resin creations, ranging from charcuterie boards and coasters to laser-engraved signs. 
              Each piece is carefully designed, often customized with names or unique details to make it truly one-of-a-kind. Whether itâ€™s 
              a simple coaster or a custom-made table, I pour creativity and passion into every project.
            </p>
